# Vite + React + TypeScript Template

Starter template for chrome extension using Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Create a new project using this template:

```bash
degit Tobyy85/chrome-extension-template

# Update and install dependencies
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm install
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure your app by changing the values in code that start with `VAR_`.
Add icons in the `public/icons` folder.

## Start development

Running `npm run dev` automatically generates the `dist` folder on file changes, so there's no need to manually rebuild during development.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run dist
```
